Conclusion:

In this project, we developed a Career Guidance App that helps job seekers find opportunities based on their skills, prepare better resumes, and get ready for interviews.
We used modern Android development tools like Splash Screen, Tab Layout, RecyclerView, ListView, Shared Preferences, and External Storage to create a smooth and user-friendly experience.
The app provides:
•	Personalized job recommendations.
•	A list of useful career skills.
•	Resume-building tips.
•	Interview preparation guides.
•	Easy navigation with tabs and fragments.
•	Call log intents and external file reading features.
Thus, the project successfully achieves its goal of guiding users toward better career opportunities through a structured and interactive mobile platform.

Future Scope

AI-based Career Recommendations:
Integrate Artificial Intelligence to analyze the user's portfolio (skills, experience, interests) and automatically suggest:
•	Best-matching job opportunities
•	Recommended courses
•	Tailored interview questions
Example: If a user lists "Java" and "Android" skills, the AI can suggest Android Developer roles or internships.

 Smart Chatbot Helpline:
Add a Chatbot that acts as a 24/7 career assistant for users.
•	Answer FAQs about resume writing, interview tips, and job application processes.
•	Solve user queries instantly without needing human support.
•	Guide users through app features (like how to upload resumes or access career tips).
Example: A user can ask: "How should I prepare for a technical interview?" and the chatbot will reply with tips.
